# Endpoint Catalog

Full inventory of every controller and action under `src/Presentation/Api/Controllers`
(public), `src/Presentation/Api/Areas/Admin/Controllers` (Admin-role gated), and
`src/Presentation/Api/Areas/Finance/Controllers` (Finance-role gated). See `overview.md` for the
envelope shape and `authentication.md` for what "Anonymous / User / Admin / Finance / ApiKey" mean
mechanically.

Conventions used below:
- **Route** is the literal string passed to `[HttpGet("...")]`/`[HttpPost("...")]`/etc., appended
  to the controller's route prefix. An empty route means the action responds at the bare
  controller path.
- **Request model** names the view model bound from the body/form/query; route-only primitive
  params are listed by name instead. Full field definitions live under
  `src/Presentation/ViewModel/<Feature>/`.
- **Response model** is the `T` inside `ApiResponse<T>` (or `ApiResponseWithFilter<T>`) that the
  action actually returns — i.e. what you'll find under `data` in the JSON body. View model classes
  live under the same `src/Presentation/ViewModel/<Feature>/` folders.
- A few actions have a mismatch between their `[Produces(...)]` attribute and what the method body
  actually returns (copy/paste artifacts); where found, both the annotated type and the real
  behavior are noted.
- All controllers below declare `[ApiVersion("1.0")]` unless noted otherwise (a couple of files
  omit it, flagged inline) — there is only one API version today.

## Public controllers (`src/Presentation/Api/Controllers/`)

Base route: `api/v{version:apiVersion}/[controller]` (controller name lowercased), e.g.
`SchoolsController` → `api/v1/schools`.

### BlogsController
`src/Presentation/Api/Controllers/BlogsController.cs` — class-level `[Permission(policy: null)]` (User by default; several actions override with `[AllowAnonymous]`)

| Verb | Route | Purpose | Auth | Request model | Response model |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `posts` | List published blog posts, filterable by tag/visibility/date/title | Anonymous | `PostsRequestViewModel` (query) | `ListDataSource<PostsResponseViewModel>` |
| GET | `posts/random` | Get a random set of published posts | Anonymous | `RandomPostsRequestViewModel` (query) | `ListDataSource<PostsResponseViewModel>` |
| GET | `posts/{postId:long}` | Get a single published post; increments view count in background | Anonymous | route: `postId` | `PostResponseViewModel` |
| DELETE | `posts/{postId:long}` | Remove a post (only if caller is its creator) | User | route: `postId` | `bool` |
| PATCH | `posts/{postId:long}/like` | Like a post | User | route: `postId` | `bool` |
| PATCH | `posts/{postId:long}/dislike` | Dislike a post | User | route: `postId` | `bool` |
| GET | `slugs/generate` | Generate a unique slug from a title | User | query: `title` | `string` |
| GET | `slugs/validate` | Check whether a slug is available | User | query: `slug` | `bool` |
| GET | `contributions` | List current user's post contributions | User | `PostContributionListRequestViewModel` (query) | `ListDataSource<PostContributionListResponseViewModel>` |
| GET | `contributions/{contributionId:long}` | Get a single post contribution owned by caller | User | route: `contributionId` | `PostContributionResponseViewModel` |
| POST | `contributions` | Create a new post contribution | User | `PostContributionViewModel` (form) | `ManagePostContributionResponseViewModel` |
| PUT | `contributions/{contributionId:long}` | Update an existing post contribution (must be creator) | User | `UpdatePostContributionViewModel` (form) + route `contributionId` | `ManagePostContributionResponseViewModel` |
| GET | `posts/{postId:long}/comments` | List comments on a post | Anonymous | `PostCommentsRequestViewModel` (query) + route `postId` | `ListDataSource<PostCommentsResponseViewModel>` |
| POST | `posts/{postId:long}/comments` | Create a comment on a post (captcha-verified) | User | `ManagePostCommentRequestViewModel` (body) + route `postId` | `ManagePostCommentResponseViewModel` |
| PATCH | `posts/{postId:long}/comments/{commentId:long}/like` | Like a comment | User | route params | `bool` |
| PATCH | `posts/{postId:long}/comments/{commentId:long}/dislike` | Dislike a comment | User | route params | `bool` |

### BoardsController
`src/Presentation/Api/Controllers/BoardsController.cs` — class-level `[Permission(policy: null)]` + `[AllowAnonymous]` (whole controller anonymous)

| Verb | Route | Purpose | Auth | Request model | Response model |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `` | List all education boards (`[ResponseCache(Duration=300)]`) | Anonymous | none | `IEnumerable<BoardsListResponseViewModel>` |

### ConnectionsController
`src/Presentation/Api/Controllers/ConnectionsController.cs` — class-level `[Permission(policy: null)]` (User for all actions, no anonymous overrides)

All `users/{id:long}/...` actions below (`followers`, `followings`, `follow`, `unfollow`,
`subscriptions/toggle`) additionally accept an optional `idType` **query string** parameter
(values: `Id` (default) or `CoreId`, case-insensitive; declared as `string?` on the action, not the
`IdentifierType` smart enum directly — Swashbuckle expands a query-bound smart-enum parameter into
its internal properties (`Name`, `Value`, ...) instead of a single named parameter, so a plain
string is parsed internally instead) — when `CoreId`, `id` is resolved against
`ApplicationUser.CoreId` (the legacy gama-api link) instead of the local `Id`, via
`IIdentityService.ResolveUserIdAsync`. Returns a `UserNotFound` error (no auto-creation) if the
`CoreId` isn't linked to any local user yet. See `docs/business/support-and-social.md`.

| Verb | Route | Purpose | Auth | Request model | Response model |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|

| GET | `users/{id:long}/followers` | List followers of a user | User | `FollowersRequestViewModel` (query) + route `id` + query `idType` | `ListDataSource<FollowViewModel>` |
| GET | `users/{id:long}/followings` | List users a given user follows | User | `FollowingsRequestViewModel` (query) + route `id` + query `idType` | `ListDataSource<FollowViewModel>` |

| POST | `users/{id:long}/unfollow` | Unfollow a user | User | `UnFollowRequestViewModel` (body) + route `id` + query `idType` | `bool` |
| PATCH | `users/{id:long}/subscriptions/toggle` | Toggle subscription to a user's activity feed | User | route: `id` + query `idType` | `bool` |
| POST | `status` | Bulk-check whether the current user follows each of a list of users (by `Id` or `CoreId`, one `idType` per request) — for "Follow"/"Following" button state, avoids duplicate follow requests | User | `ConnectionStatusRequestViewModel` (body) | `IEnumerable<ConnectionStatusResponseViewModel>` |

### ExamsController
`src/Presentation/Api/Controllers/ExamsController.cs` — class-level `[Permission(policy: null)]` (User). **Deviation:** no `[ApiVersion]` attribute (only `[ApiController]`).

| Verb | Route | Purpose | Auth | Request model | Response model |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `export` | Export an exam to a file, gated by a `SecretKey` header | User | `ExportExamRequestViewModel` (query) + `SecretKey` header | Declared `IActionResult`; error path returns `ApiResponse<Void>`, success path returns a raw `FileContentResult` (binary file), not the envelope |

### ExperiencesController
`src/Presentation/Api/Controllers/ExperiencesController.cs` — class-level `[Permission(policy: null)]` (User, no anonymous overrides)

| Verb | Route | Purpose | Auth | Request model | Response model |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `` | List current user's experiences | User | `ExperiencesRequestViewModel` (query) | `ListDataSource<ExperienceResponseViewModel>` |
| GET | `{id:long}` | Get a single experience owned by caller | User | route: `id` | `ExperienceResponseViewModel` |
| POST | `` | Create a new experience entry | User | `ManageExperienceRequestViewModel` (body) | `ManageExperienceResponseViewModel` |
| PUT | `{id:long}` | Update an existing experience entry | User | `ManageExperienceRequestViewModel` (body) + route `id` | `ManageExperienceResponseViewModel` |
| DELETE | `{id:long}` | Remove an experience entry (owned by caller) | User | route: `id` | `bool` |

### FilesController
`src/Presentation/Api/Controllers/FilesController.cs` — class-level `[Permission(policy: null)]` + `[AllowAnonymous]` (whole controller anonymous)

| Verb | Route | Purpose | Auth | Request model | Response model |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `{containerType:ContainerType}/{id}` | Resolve a stored file's URL and redirect to it | Anonymous | route: `containerType` (enum), `id` | Declared `ApiResponse<string>`; actually returns empty `ApiResponse<string>` (not found) or an HTTP redirect (`RedirectResult`) |

### GamesController
`src/Presentation/Api/Controllers/GamesController.cs` — **no class-level auth attribute** (each action carries its own). Now carries `[ApiVersion("1.0")]` + `[ApiVersion("2.0")]` (added for the `spends` split below) — every other action is unmapped and so still serves both versions unchanged.

| Verb | Route | Purpose | Auth | Request model | Response model |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `easter-egg/fortune-wheel` | Spin the "fortune wheel" easter egg, awarding coins | **ApiKey** | none | `CoinsResponseViewModel` |

| POST | `test-time` | Record a "test time" quiz answer/timing | User | `TestTimeQuizRequestViewModel` (body) | `TestTimeQuizResponseViewModel` |
| POST | `exams/points` | Award points for exam completion, gated by `SecretKey` header | User | `ExamPointsRequestViewModel` (body) + `SecretKey` header | `ExamPointsResponseViewModel` (note: `[Produces]` attribute misnames this as `TestTimeQuizResponseViewModel`) |
| POST | `spends` (v1.0) | Spend on pastpaper/test download — tries the caller's subscription quota first (see `docs/business/subscriptions.md`), falls back to wallet points unchanged | User | `SpendPointsRequestViewModel` (body) | `bool` (unchanged wire shape) |
| POST | `spends` (v2.0) | Same action as v1, richer response for clients that want to show which path paid and any upgrade upsell | User | `SpendPointsRequestViewModel` (body) | `SpendPointsResponseViewModel` (`spent`, `paidBy`, `remainingQuota`, `upgradeSuggestions[]`) |

### GradesController
`src/Presentation/Api/Controllers/GradesController.cs` — class-level `[Permission(policy: null)]` + `[AllowAnonymous]` (whole controller anonymous)

| Verb | Route | Purpose | Auth | Request model | Response model |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `` | List grades, optionally filtered by board id | Anonymous | `GradesRequestViewModel` (query) | `ListDataSource<GradesResponseViewModel>` |

### HomeController
`src/Presentation/Api/Controllers/HomeController.cs` — **no `[Route]`, no `[ApiVersion]`, no auth attribute at all**; not built on `ApiControllerBase<T>`'s versioned route, doesn't use the `ApiResponse<T>` envelope. Effectively a non-API MVC controller.

| Verb | Route | Purpose | Auth | Request model | Response model |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| GET | (default MVC route) | Redirects `/` to `/swagger` | Anonymous (implicit — no `[Authorize]`-derived attribute present) | none | none (plain redirect) |

### IdentitiesController
`src/Presentation/Api/Controllers/IdentitiesController.cs` — **no class-level auth attribute**; every action annotates itself. See `authentication.md` for the login/token flows in detail.

| Verb | Route | Purpose | Auth | Request model | Response model |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| POST | `login` | Authenticate with username/password; issues the Identity cookie | Anonymous | `AuthenticationRequestViewModel` (body) | `AuthenticationResponseViewModel` |
| POST | `register` | Register a new local account; queues welcome email | Anonymous | `RegistrationRequestViewModel` (body) | `Void` (no data) |
| GET | `logout` | Sign the current user out | User | none | `Void` (no data) |
| PUT | `password` | Change current user's password | User | `ChangePasswordRequestViewModel` (body) | `Void` (no data) |
| POST | `tokens` | Authenticate and issue an opaque bearer token | Anonymous | `GenerateTokenRequestViewModel` (body) | `GenerateTokenResponseViewModel` |
| POST | `tokens/old` | (doc comment: "temporary, must delete") Exchange a legacy/core token for a new token | Anonymous | `GenerateTokenWithOldRequestViewModel` (body) | `GenerateTokenResponseViewModel` |
| POST | `tokens/google` | Authenticate via Google OAuth and issue a bearer token | Anonymous | `GenerateTokenWithGoogleRequestViewModel` (body) | `GenerateTokenResponseViewModel` |
| POST | `tokens/revoke` | Revoke current user's API access token | User | none | `RevokeTokenResponseViewModel` |
| GET | `authenticated` | Check whether the current request is authenticated | Anonymous (class default overridden) | none | `bool` |

| DELETE | `profiles` | Request deletion of own account (re-authenticates first) | User | `DeleteAccountRequestViewModel` (body) | `bool` |
| PATCH | `profiles/recover` | Cancel a pending account-deletion request (re-authenticates first) | User | `RecoverAccountRequestViewModel` (body) | `bool` |
| GET | `handles/validate` | Check whether a profile handle is available | User | query: `handle` | `string` |

### LegacyAuthBridgeController — temporary
`src/Presentation/Api/Controllers/LegacyAuthBridgeController.cs` — route `api/v1/legacy-auth`, class-level `[AllowAnonymous]`. Proxies gama-api (the old backend); see `authentication.md`'s "Legacy-auth bridge" section. Slated for removal once the frontend migrates off gama-api.

| Verb | Route | Purpose | Auth | Request model | Response model |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| POST | `login` | Proxy gama-api login; sync local user, return gama-api's own token unchanged. Weak passwords get an OTP step-up instead (`Type`/`Code` fields, `type: "confirm"` to complete — see `authentication.md`) | Anonymous | `LegacyLoginRequestViewModel` (body) | `LegacyAuthTokenResponseViewModel` |
| POST | `google` | Proxy gama-api googleAuth; same sync behavior as `login` | Anonymous | `LegacyGoogleAuthRequestViewModel` (body) | `LegacyAuthTokenResponseViewModel` |
| POST | `register` | Pure passthrough to gama-api register (multi-step OTP); no local sync, no token | Anonymous | `LegacyOtpFlowRequestViewModel` (body) | `LegacyMessageResponseViewModel` |
| POST | `recovery` | Pure passthrough to gama-api recovery/reset-password (multi-step OTP); no local sync, no token | Anonymous | `LegacyOtpFlowRequestViewModel` (body) | `LegacyMessageResponseViewModel` |
| GET | `logout` | Proxies gama-api's `GET /users/logout`, relaying the caller's raw legacy JWT from the `Authorization` header; on success also records the token in a local blocklist (TTL = token's remaining `exp`) so this backend stops honoring it too | Anonymous (token supplied via header, validated by gama-api itself) | none (`Authorization: Bearer {gama-api JWT}` header) | `Void` |

### LanguagesController
`src/Presentation/Api/Controllers/LanguagesController.cs` — class-level `[Permission(policy: null)]` + `[AllowAnonymous]` (whole controller anonymous)

| Verb | Route | Purpose | Auth | Request model | Response model |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `` | List active languages (with RTL flag) | Anonymous | none | `IEnumerable<ActiveLanguageViewModel>` |
| GET | `time-zones` | List available time zones | Anonymous | none | `IEnumerable<TimeZoneViewModel>` |

### LocationsController
`src/Presentation/Api/Controllers/LocationsController.cs` — class-level `[Permission(policy: null)]` + `[AllowAnonymous]` (whole controller anonymous)

| Verb | Route | Purpose | Auth | Request model | Response model |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `countries` | List countries (paged) | Anonymous | `LocationsRequestViewModel` (query) | `ListDataSource<LocationsResponseViewModel>` |
| GET | `states/{countryId}` | List states of a country (paged) | Anonymous | route: `countryId` + `LocationsRequestViewModel` (query) | `ListDataSource<LocationsResponseViewModel>` |
| GET | `cities/{stateId}` | List cities of a state (paged) | Anonymous | route: `stateId` + `LocationsRequestViewModel` (query) | `ListDataSource<LocationsResponseViewModel>` |

### MessagesController
`src/Presentation/Api/Controllers/MessagesController.cs` — class-level `[Permission(policy: null)]` (User, no anonymous overrides)

| PUT | `{id:long}` | Edit an existing message | User | route: `id` + `ManageMessageRequestViewModel` (body) | `Void` (no data) |
| PATCH | `{id:long}/toggle` | Toggle a message's read/unread state | User | route: `id` | `Void` (no data) |
| DELETE | `{id:long}` | Remove an unread message sent by the current user | User | route: `id` | `bool` |

### PaymentsController
`src/Presentation/Api/Controllers/PaymentsController.cs` — class-level `[Permission(policy: null)]` (User, no anonymous overrides). `VerifyPayment` has known hardening needs around concurrent verification and caller authorization — see [`docs/business/payments-and-points.md`](../business/payments-and-points.md) (details kept in an internal, non-public review rather than this repo). `VerifyPayment` also now branches on whether the payment was created for a subscription purchase (see `SubscriptionsController.PurchaseSubscription` below and `docs/business/subscriptions.md`) — same route and response shape either way, only the server-side effect differs.

| Verb | Route | Purpose | Auth | Request model | Response model |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| POST | `` | Create a payment (returns gateway redirect URL) | User | `CreatePaymentRequestViewModel` (body) | `CreatePaymentResponseViewModel` |
| POST | `{id:long}/verify` | Verify a payment transaction with the gateway; activates a subscription instead of crediting points when the payment was for one | User | route: `id` + `VerifyPaymentRequestViewModel` (body) | `bool` |

### QuestionsController
`src/Presentation/Api/Controllers/QuestionsController.cs` — class-level `[Permission(policy: null)]` (User, no anonymous overrides)

### ReferralController

| Verb | Route | Purpose | Auth | Request model | Response model |

| POST | `{schoolId:long}/images/{imageId:long}/contributions` | Request removal of a school image | User | route params + `RemoveSchoolImageContributionRequestViewModel` (body) | `RemoveSchoolImageContributionResponseViewModel` (note: `[Produces]` attribute misnames this as `bool`) |
| GET | `{schoolId:long}/contributions` | List caller's contributions for a school (paged) | User | route: `schoolId` + `SchoolContributionListRequestViewModel` (query) | `ListDataSource<SchoolContributionInfoListResponseViewModel>` |

## Admin controllers (`src/Presentation/Api/Areas/Admin/Controllers/`)

Base route: `api/v{version:apiVersion}/[area]/[controller]` → `api/v1/admin/<controller>`.
Every controller in this area declares class-level `[Common.DataAnnotation.Area(nameof(Admin), "Admin")]`
(or the equivalent `nameof(Role.Admin)` form — same resolved area name) and class-level
`[Permission(Roles = [nameof(Role.Admin)])]`. **No action in any of the 18 Admin controllers
carries `[AllowAnonymous]` or a different role** — the whole area is uniformly Admin-only; the
Auth column is omitted per-row below and stated once per controller instead.

### ApplicationSettingsController — Admin-only
`src/Presentation/Api/Areas/Admin/Controllers/ApplicationSettingsController.cs` — route `api/v1/admin/applicationsettings`

| Verb | Route | Purpose | Request model | Response model |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `` | Get current application settings (points, templates, timezone, page size) | none | `ApplicationSettingsViewModel` |
| PUT | `` | Update application settings | `ApplicationSettingsViewModel` (body) | `bool` |

### BlogsController — Admin-only
`src/Presentation/Api/Areas/Admin/Controllers/BlogsController.cs` — route `api/v1/admin/blogs`

| Verb | Route | Purpose | Request model | Response model |

## Finance controller (`src/Presentation/Api/Areas/Finance/Controllers/`)

Base route: `api/v{version:apiVersion}/[area]/[controller]` → `api/v1/finance/payments`.

## Notable attribute/behavior mismatches found while cataloging

A few actions have a `[Produces(...)]` attribute that doesn't match what the method body actually
returns. These are source-level inconsistencies (not doc errors) — the table entries above already
report the *actual* runtime response type, with the mismatch called out:

- `GamesController.ExamPoints` — declares `TestTimeQuizResponseViewModel`, returns `ExamPointsResponseViewModel`.
- `ExamsController.Export` — declares generic `IActionResult`, actually branches between `ApiResponse<Void>` and a raw file stream.
- `FilesController.GetFile` — declares `ApiResponse<string>`, can also short-circuit to an HTTP redirect.
- `SchoolsController` (public) `RequestRemoveSchoolImage`-style action — declares `bool`, returns `RemoveSchoolImageContributionResponseViewModel`.
- `LocationsController` (Admin) `UpdateState` — declares `Void`, returns `ManageLocationResponseViewModel`.
- `PaymentsController` (Admin) `Export` — declares `ApiResponse<string>`, success path returns a raw `FileContentResult` (xlsx download).

Also flagged for review (not mismatches, but noteworthy deviations from the codebase's own
conventions): `HomeController` has no `[Route]`/`[ApiVersion]`/auth attribute at all;
`ExamsController` omits `[ApiVersion("1.0")]`; and
`VotingPowersController`'s bulk-import `POST` is fully anonymous and relies solely on an in-body
signature check rather than any `[Authorize]`-derived attribute.

`GamesController` was the first controller in the solution to carry two `[ApiVersion]`
attributes (`spends` needed a v1-compatible bare-`bool` response alongside a richer v2
response for the new subscription-quota upsell — see `docs/business/subscriptions.md`).
Every other action on it has no `[MapToApiVersion]` and so is served under both versions
unchanged.
